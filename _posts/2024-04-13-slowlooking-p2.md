Yes, there's so much life to be discovered in nature. I mentioned in the post [“Understanding the World through “Slow Looking” (Part 1)”]({ site.baseurl }}{% link 2024-04-12-slowlooking-p1.md %}). And Wheatley (2006) wonders why we tend to quickly settle on a single idea, structure, or perception or cling to the notion that there's an objective "truth." She questions the common belief that there's only one way to approach or understand something, pointing out that the universe is filled with diversity and countless interpretations. Practicing “slow-looking” and deep observation invites learners (including teachers and students) to connect with their surroundings deeply, enabling them to see not just with their eyes but all their senses, including their emotional and spiritual senses.


## Does it involve mindfulness and meditation? 

From an educational perspective, Shari Tishman (2017) explains that “slow-looking” is less spiritually ambitious than mindfulness but 
is much more inclusive. It can be mindfulness, but it doesn't have to. The practice of slow-looking varies widely. 
I remember during my master’s in [Leadership for Sustainability Education](https://www.pdx.edu/academics/programs/graduate/leadership-sustainability-education) 
at Portland State University, our wonderful professor Heather 
often started our core classes with intention-setting and grounding exercises. These exercises helped create a space where the multiple 
dimensions of things could be perceived and appreciated, which included readings, reflections, and discussions.
Also, museums like MoMA have embraced this through their [Artful Practices for Well-being program](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/322), which includes activities like mindful 
walks. These walks encourage participants to slow down and actively notice the little joys of their neighborhoods, sometimes capturing 
these moments through photography, videos, paintings, and poems. If “stopping and looking closely” is a repeated engagement, it cultivates 
the connection between Self and Place. Each pause to observe and each moment spent in contemplation builds layers of familiarity and affection, 
allowing us to tune into the rhythms and dynamics of this connection. 

## How do we nurture the connection between children and place through slow-looking?

Slow-looking is a sensory-based invitation: wandering, listening, watching, smelling, and sometimes tasting. And the point here is 
to get children to see things through a new lens, which they’ve often looked at for so long. What could they see in a place and do 
with a place? A place is more than just the physical environment, from urban settings, with big buildings and four-lane highways, 
to rural areas with mountains and beaches. The character of a place is defined by the people and their relationship with their environment. 


Trees, sky, birds, rain, ants, winds, dirt, ponds, and so much more in a place. Two years ago, I joined a summer camp as an Educator 
for a range of students aged 5 - 15. Every day, we spent about ⅔ time outdoors, built forts, got wet and muddy, made maps, climbed trees, 
caught salamanders, listened to birds' songs, learned to identify local trees and plants, and observed silently and not-so-silently, and 
came back inside with grinning faces, dirt under the fingernails, and a rekindled joy that comes from knowing our campsite (a farm) 
a little bit and a little bit more. We build slowly from wonder to questions to analysis and answers.


Engaging children through thoughtful attention to the things around them is like taking them on a journey to reconnect with nature. 
This intimacy with nature isn't just about love and respect; it's also about getting our hands dirty and discovering the gritty and 
secretive parts where personal connections and private moments happen. Building this deep, intimate knowledge of nature goes beyond 
the facts and stories we find in textbooks. Sadly, many children today lack a close relationship with the natural world. That's why it's 
so crucial to start exploring any nearby place—whether it's a neighborhood, a backyard, or a schoolyard—as a first step. These experiences 
offer them a real feel for where they live, which is very different from just riding in a car or sitting in a classroom.


Time is important, whether it's quiet moments to soak in our surroundings using all our senses, like during sit spot experiences, 
or revisiting the same place several times. I first learned about "sit spot" time during my Forest Therapy Guide training, and each time, 
I was amazed by the experience. Although the term itself isn’t my favorite, I love the idea of having a (hidden) gem spot to do nothing 
at my own pace. A sit spot is a place away from distractions where you can sit, observe and/or journal. And it’s a favorite place 
that can be revisited across the seasons.


Naturally, I encouraged my students to find their own “sit spot” time*. I observed one student hiding under a bush, looking 
at spider web for ten minutes, while another used that time to attempt to call a bird in a nearby tree. Sure, we've learned about 
scientific concepts like cohesion, but the real growth I've seen in my students is their willingness to be curious, to wonder, 
to slow down, and to explore the world around them.


(*) *Your child can spend anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour in their Sit Spot, depending on their age and how comfortable they 
are outside. It’s common for kids to struggle with sitting still for long, which is why having a Sit Spot is so beneficial. 
As your child gets more used to their Sit Spot, you can introduce "Noticing the Details" writing or drawing. This activity 
involves observing a natural object closely and describing its shape, texture, smell, and color in detail. Encourage your 
child to really focus on the object and discover details they might have overlooked at first glance.*
