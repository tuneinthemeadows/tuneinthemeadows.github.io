There were days in the forest school…

A six-year-old ran happily, dragging a stick on the ground. She stopped to check out a steep hill, then slid down carefully on pine needles. Her friends waited below to work on their secret hideout by a big rock. They gathered sticks and logs neatly, stacking them up. The girl proudly handed her sticks to two friends who figured out how to use them for support between the rock and a tall stump. Another kid was on the hunt for acorns, flowers, and wild fruits to jazz up their hideout. They all gave it a good shake and poke to make sure it was sturdy….

We played a role-play game where the kids pretended to be their favorite plants as we walked together. One chose to be a blackberry tree, another imagined themselves as a fern. They were reminded to walk slowly and observe their surroundings carefully, noticing who their neighbors were and what ecosystems they were passing through – whether it was a paved road, a forested gravel trail, a meadow, or a shaded, moist forested trail. Some even swayed gently, mimicking the movements of their chosen plant. We sometimes stopped and gazed at any spots in front of us:

I asked, “What are you seeing?” 
“Green, rain drops, water, leaves, purple flowers, dirt,…” kids said
“Let’s close your eyes and count 1 to 5 and open your eyes, what else are you seeing this time?” 
Water, flowers, spiders, golden bugs, bark and some thing’s moving…it’s a baby snail, few kids enthusiastically said
On a forest bathing walk, a participant shared…

"I found out there’s a ton of cool stuff on the ground while I walked slowly. I used to think there’s only one way to see things. But when I walked along the river, slowly and quietly, I noticed beautiful little tiny things like water spiders were staying still on the leaves and reflections of trees. There’s so much to see in just one little thing, I just gotta take a look."

The term “the slow movement” was coined by Carl Honoré in 2005. He argued that as the opposite of modern fast-paced living epitomized by fast-food, instant information, rapid fashion, and so on, which not only harms our planet but also undermines our well-being.

The concept of “slow” has also been extended to the context of academia. For example, Berg and Seeber (2013) argued against resisting the neoliberal pressures prevalent in universities, including those related to publishing, teaching, research, and administration. Drawing inspiration from these foundational ideas of “slow,” Briony Supple (2023) explores the pedagogical value of embracing slowness within educational spaces. This perspective is aligned with research by M’Balia and Carvajal Regidor (2021), who challenge the emphasis on outcomes and shift focus away from the mind as the sole source of knowledge, thereby making room for the body and spirit, and Franzese and Felten (2017) prioritize fostering connections and creating meaning in the learning process in their study related to the experience of contemplative pedagogies.

Imagine if more people, especially children, became “slow lookers” – taking their time to really see the world around. It’s not just about looking slowly; it’s about appreciating the details and complexities in what we see. According to Tishman (2017), this mindset goes beyond just enjoying and appreciating what we observe; it helps us understand the different parts and purposes of the things around us. When we grasp these details, we’re inspired to think creatively and come up with new ideas. In other words, when we slow down and practice seeing and hearing, our awareness of what is happening around us (even inside us) gets sharpened.

The natural world is a rich place to practice “slow looking” by engaging in sensory observation. Have you ever taken a stroll along a sandy beach, listening to the gentle waves? Most of the time, I like picking up seashells and marveling at their spiral patterns and sparkling colors. Sometimes, I would stop and stare at tiny crabs scuttling across the sand, leaving intricate patterns of tracks behind them. So much life would be able to be found here.
