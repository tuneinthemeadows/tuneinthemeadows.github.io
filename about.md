Hi, I am Ly. I am a co-facilitator and co-creator of communities and learning opportunities for K-adult learners. All beings are equal and deserve to be loved and cared for. That means inviting the presence of the whole self and the Earth in and within my work. Here is centered on care, co-creation, and interconnection, which are necessary to make meaningful transformation and growth.

Working years with different learners in non-profit environmental education programs and nature-rich learning environments has allowed me to notice that the Earth is much more than a subject, not only to learn and to live with but also to recognize that we are all ultimately one and the same.

I wonder what the relationship between humans and more-than-humans could look and feel like? Could it be love? Could it be a sense of belonging? Have we been seeing the Earth as a home or a shelter? I wonder how the relationship between us and land could be decolonized and unpacked through the learning journey.

I’m excited to share that I’ll be starting my Ph.D. journey at Michigan State University this Fall, majoring in Curriculum, Instruction, and Teacher Education. As I embark on this new chapter, I’m eager to delve deeper into nature-based teaching and learning. My goal is to not only enrich my understanding but also to share these wonders with others, particularly education practitioners in Vietnam and around the world. That’s why I’m getting back to tuneinthemeadows.com (a writing platform)—to continue this journey of discovery and to collaborate with like-minded individuals passionate about the transformative power of nature in education. This website is to share insightful thoughts, notes, and research from the learning field. My focus will be on intentional co-creation with outdoor spaces and nature across different learning settings, fostering play and promoting overall well-being.

In 2020, I came to the U.S. to pursue my master’s at Portland State University, studying Leadership for Sustainable Education (LSE) through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. The LSE and Forest Therapy Guide training journeys have opened the possibility of weaving who I am, what I have been dreaming, and what I have been doing. This possibility is guided by slowing down, observing, listening to wisdom from the Earth and others, reflecting, and connecting more deeply to ourselves, our communities, and our surroundings.
